## Technologies

I used React, React/Redux, ReactRouter, HTML, CSS to get things done

This project is used for fetching data from api, sorting data, and filtrating data.
Also, it capable of saving user filter state via, URL. So user don't loose his search progress even after page refresh.

This app was designed by me to be max flexible and easy to expand.
